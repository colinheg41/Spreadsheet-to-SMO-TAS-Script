This is a converter from a .tsv, that you export from a spreadsheet, to a .txt
that can be used as a script for TAS-nx. Here is a link to TAS-nx:

I made a video tutorial on how to use these tools. It'll just take a minute or two to
understand the basics, but I go explain more about how to utilize the "modify" tool,
which is very helpful for testing frame windows. Here is the tutorial:

modify.exe reads the parameters from modify.txt to make copies of your .tsv
convert.exe reads the .tsv filename from modify.txt and converts .tsv's with that filename
  and any with the same filename but "(x)" appended to it, where x is in the range of 0-9.
